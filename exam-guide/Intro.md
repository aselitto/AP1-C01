Exam content

Question types
The exam contains one or more of the following question types:

Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors).

Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options. You must select all the correct responses to receive credit for the question.

Ordering: Has a list of 3–5 responses to complete a specified task. You must select the correct responses and place the responses in the correct order to receive credit for the question.

Matching: Has a list of responses to match with a list of 3–7 prompts. You must match all the pairs correctly to receive credit for the question.

Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect. There is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 65 questions that affect your score.

Unscored content
The exam includes 10 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate them for future use as scored questions. The unscored questions are not identified on the exam.

Exam results
The AWS Certified Generative AI Developer - Professional (AIP-C01) exam has a pass or fail designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.

Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 750. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.

Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam.

Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than other sections have. The table of classifications contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you interpret section-level feedback.
